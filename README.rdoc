This is a project-in-progress that grew from a challenge to make a personal project based on my master's thesis.

It attempts to present historical information from the appendix of my master's thesis in an easy format. Bringing not just 8th century Middle Eastern History, but any educational information to the internet is something I will want to keep doing.

The end goal is to give educators and students a source for information on people, maps, factions, family trees, and timelines from the late 500's until the Reign of al-Mahdi in 775. It will allow for easier access to obscure historical figures, greatly helping students learn about this vital time period.

It is in the process of being switched from a Sinatra app: https://github.com/estensland/Sinatra_crescent
